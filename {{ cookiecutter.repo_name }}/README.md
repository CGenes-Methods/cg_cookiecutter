## Overview

## Requirements

To run the code in this GitHub repository, please make sure your system meets the following requirements:

* Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, â€¦);
* [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) installed, including shell hooks;
* [`.envrc`](.envrc) allowed/trusted by `direnv` to use the environment variables - see
[below](#allowingtrusting-envrc);
{%- if cookiecutter.create_secrets_file == "Yes" %}
* If missing, [create a `.secrets` file](#creating-a-secrets-file) to store untracked secrets;{% endif %}
* Python 3.5 or above; and
* Python packages installed from the `requirements.txt` file.

Note there may be some Python IDE-specific requirements around loading environment variables, which are not considered
here.

### Allowing/trusting `.envrc`

To allow/trust the [`.envrc`](.envrc) run the `allow` command using `direnv` at the top level of this repository.

```shell script
direnv allow
```
{% if cookiecutter.create_secrets_file == "Yes" %}
### Creating a `.secrets` file

Secrets used by this repository can be stored in a `.secrets` file. **This is not tracked by Git**, and so secrets will
not be committed onto your remote.

In your shell terminal, at the top level of the repository, create a `.secrets` file.

```shell script
touch .secrets
```

Open this new `.secrets` file using a text editor, and add any secrets as environmental variables. For example, to add
a JSON credentials file for Google BigQuery, add the following code to `.secrets`.

```shell script
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/credentials.json"
```
{% endif %}
### Installing Python packages

To install required Python packages via `pip`, first [set up a Python virtual
environment](#creating-a-python-virtual-environment); this ensures you do not install the packages globally.

Then run the following `make` command at the top level of this repository:

```shell script
make requirements
```

### Creating a Python virtual environment

Creating a Python virtual environment depends on whether you are using [base Python](#base-python-interpreter) or
[Anaconda](#anaconda-interpreter) as your interpreter.

#### Base Python interpreter

If you are using base Python, there are multiple ways to create virtual environments in Python using `pip`, including
(but not limited to):

* [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html);
* [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/);
* [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv); and
* [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with its `virtualenv` [plugin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).

Follow the documentation of your chosen method to create a Python virtual environment.

#### Anaconda interpreter

If you are using [Anaconda or `conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/), following their
[documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to set up a
conda environment.
