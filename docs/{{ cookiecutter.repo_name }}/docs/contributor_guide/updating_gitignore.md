## `.gitignore` in the `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}` folder

If you are adding or modifying `.gitignore` files, please note that the `.gitignore` in
the `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}` template folder can be different to those at the
top-level of the repository, especially around which folders, and files are excluded.

If you wish to add or modify the template `.gitignore` file, it's strongly recommended
that you build an example repository, and test out your changes.
